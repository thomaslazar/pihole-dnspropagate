# Introduce Versioning & Release Documentation
- Type: Story
- Phase: 8
- Prerequisites: PIDP-013
- Status: Completed

## Context
To ship `v1.0.0` and future releases consistently, the repository needs an authoritative version source and written release procedures. This includes a `VERSION` file or MSBuild property, plus step-by-step instructions for maintainers.

## Work Items
- [x] Decide on version source (root `VERSION` + MSBuild integration) and seed with `1.0.0`.
- [x] Update build pipeline to read the version (assembly info, Docker image tagging).
- [x] Author `docs/release-process.md` explaining pre-release checklist, tagging rules, and rollback steps.
- [x] Document version bump workflow for patches/minor/major releases.
- [x] Use Mermaid diagrams for any illustrated release/version flows in documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Repository includes a single authoritative version entry used by builds.
- [x] Documentation outlines the full release procedure from PR to tag.
- [ ] Maintainer sign-off on the written process.

## Notes
- Coordinate with automation tasks to ensure the workflow consumes the version source.
