# Build Testing & Quality Suite
- Type: Story
- Phase: 6
- Prerequisites: PIDP-007
- Status: Planned

## Context
Establish comprehensive testing for orchestration, archive processing, and configuration to meet coverage goals and CI integration.

## Work Items
- [ ] Implement unit tests covering configuration binding, validation, and coordinator logic.
- [ ] Build helper fixtures and in-memory Teleporter archives for fast testing.
- [ ] Add regression tests asserting only `pihole.toml` differs between original and synced Teleporter zips.
- [ ] Add Testcontainers-based integration tests spinning up Pi-hole instances and clean up volumes/networks after runs.
- [ ] Add coverage reporting (`dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`).
- [ ] Configure CI pipeline template (GitHub Actions) running build, test, coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test suite achieves â‰¥80% coverage on critical projects.
- [ ] CI pipeline executes successfully with status badges ready for README.
- [ ] Integration tests reliably provision and tear down Pi-hole containers without manual steps and leave no residual Docker resources.
- [ ] Regression tests confirm non-TOML files remain unchanged post-sync.

## Notes
- Consider using Coverlet collector settings for deterministic coverage output.
